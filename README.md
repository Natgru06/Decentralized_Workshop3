# Decentralized_Workshop3

## Practical Exercise: From Local to Decentralized Computation

We build three Flask application one of each use different machine learning algorithms : SVM, logistic regression and random forest. As the dataset we simply choose the iris dataset avaible in sklearn python library

We connect our flask application to ngrok so each of us send a request to another and test it :

https://a17f-195-154-48-144.ngrok-free.app/predict?sepal_length=1&sepal_width=1&petal_length=1&petal_width=1

this is one of the request that we can send to the ngrok server
